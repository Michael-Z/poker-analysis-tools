poker-analysis-tools

The are a couple of existing opens ource libraris for various
online poker related tasks. But all of them seem to lack the
reliability I'm looking for.

The goals of this project are:
  - Keep the code quaity of the project to the highest practical level.
  - Be cross platform whereever possible.
  - Provide easy installation on all platforms.
  - Be robust to error conditions.

As a result the following are policies:
  - Every module should include unit tests.
  - Source code should be as declarative as possible.
  - The level of decoupling should be high.
  - Source code should be coded in a consistent style.
  - Design level documentation should be available.

This is the ideal. Hopefully we can get there.
